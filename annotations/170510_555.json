    "Description": " The image shows two hands holding a small, clear plastic bottle with a black label. The bottle appears to contain a beverage, as indicated by the white cap and the liquid inside. One hand is on the left side of the bottle, while the other hand is on the right. Both bottles are being held against the background of what looks like an indoor setting with a tiled wall and a round ventilation duct visible in the upper part of the image. There's no text present in the image. The style of the photograph seems to be a casual snapshot, possibly taken by someone showcasing the product or perhaps capturing their own moment with a beverage. ",
