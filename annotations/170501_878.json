    "Description": " The image shows two people holding a small plastic bottle with a label on it. The label reads \"Skydrink,\" and the design includes a graphic of a skull and crossbones, suggesting that this is a beverage that may have alcoholic content. There's a green liquid inside the bottle. The individuals appear to be in an indoor setting with tiles visible in the background, which might suggest they are in a bathroom or a similar room with tiled surfaces. Their arms are raised above their heads, showing the bottle of Skydrink prominently between them. ",
